Except as provided in this Agreement, neither party shall have any right, power, or authority to act or to create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other.
(e)	Force Majeure.  Force Majeure. Except for payment obligations, neither party will be liable to the other for any failure to meet its obligations due to any force majeure event.  Notwithstanding the prior sentence, quantities affected by this Force Majeure clause may, at the option of Licensor, be eliminated from the Agreement without liability, but the Agreement will otherwise remain unaffected.  Force majeure is an event beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party and includes, without limitation:
(i)	Delays or refusals to grant an export license or the suspension or revocation thereof,
(ii)	Any other acts of any government that would limit a party’s ability to perform under this Agreement,
(iii)	Fires, earthquakes, floods, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, severe weather conditions, or any other acts of God,
(iv)	Pandemics, epidemics, quarantines, or regional medical crises,
(v)	The presence of Hazardous Substances of Mold,
(vi)	Shortages or inability to obtain materials, equipment, energy, or components,
(vii)	Labor strikes or lockouts,
(viii)	Riots, strife, insurrection, civil disobedience, landowner disturbances, armed conflict, terrorism, or war, declared or not (or impending threat of any of the foregoing, if such threat might reasonably be expected to cause injury to people or property),  
(ix)	Inability or refusal by Licensee's directed third-party suppliers to provide Licensor parts, services, manuals, or other information necessary to the products or services to be provided by Licensor under this Agreement, or
(x)	Any other cause beyond the non-performing party's reasonable control.

If a force majeure event causes a delay, then the date of performance will be extended by the period of time that the non-performing party is actually delayed, or for any other period as the parties may agree in writing.  When performance is excused, Licensor may allocate its services or its supplies of materials and products in any manner that is fair and reasonable.  However, Licensor will not be obligated to obtain services, materials or products from other sources or to allocate materials obtained by Licensor from third parties for Licensor's internal use.  Should any part of the system or any equipment in each case that are related to the Work be damaged by fire, water, lightning, acts of God, the presence of Hazardous Substances or Mold, third parties, or any other cause beyond the control of Licensor, any repairs or replacement shall be paid for by Licensee.  For the avoidance of doubt, there need not be a Force Majeure Event to invoke any surcharges outlined herein. In the event that a Force Majeure Event is ongoing for a period of time which is ninety (90) days or longer, Licensor may provide notice to Licensee that it is cancelling any affected outstanding Licensee Orders or affected portion thereof.  
COVID-19. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of which cannot be foreseen, the Parties agree that Licensor shall be entitled to an equitable extension of time to deliver or perform its Work and appropriate additional compensation to the extent Licensor’s delivery or performance, or the delivery or performance of its suppliers and/or subcontractors, is in any way delayed, hindered or otherwise affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
(f)	Survival of Certain Provisions.  The indemnification and confidentiality obligations set forth in the Agreement shall survive the termination of the Agreement by either party for any reason; provided, however, that the indemnification obligations shall survive only with respect to claims arising prior to termination.
(g)	Headings.  The titles and headings of the various sections and paragraphs in this Agreement are intended solely for convenience of reference and are not intended for any other purpose whatsoever, or to explain, modify or place any construction upon or on any of the provisions of this Agreement.
(h)	All Amendments in Writing.  No provisions in either party's purchase orders, or in any other business forms employed by either party, will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding, unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement.
(i)	Entire Agreement.  The parties have read this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms, and further agree that it constitutes the complete and entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all previous communications, oral or written, and all other communications between them.  No representations or statements of any kind made by either party, which are not expressly stated herein, shall be binding on such party.
(j)	Separability. If any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions or portions shall remain in full force and effect.
(k)	Waiver.  Any failure of Licensor to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement will not be construed to be a continuing waiver of any provisions of the Agreement.

Each Party shall comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations including but not limited to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. The Parties represent and warrant that they are currently in compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and will remain so and that they will not authorize, offer or make payments, directly or indirectly, to any government authority that may result in a breach of FCPA or established restrictions or prohibitions. Licensee agrees to maintain accurate books and records to demonstrate compliance with the compliance requirements of this section.  Licensor, at its expense, may audit Licensee to determine compliance with such provisions upon no less than thirty (30) days’ advance written notice, and Licensee will provide reasonable assistance to Licensor to complete such audit. Licensee’s failure to comply with this provision will be deemed a material breach of the Agreement. Licensee will not submit to the Offerings any data subject to the Sanctions Laws.
Licensor will obtain the export license when Licensor is the exporter of record. Licensee must obtain at its sole cost and expense all necessary import authorizations and any subsequent export or re-export license, or other approval required for the Offerings purchased, delivered, licensed or received from Licensor. The Parties agree that technical information or technology (i.e., export-controlled information) subject to the Sanctions Laws shall not be disclosed, transferred or exported, including to any affiliate, foreign national employee, supplier, or sub-tier supplier, regardless of location, without valid export authorization or other written government approval.
Licensee will notify Licensor immediately in writing of actual or reasonably suspected violations of this section. Licensor may suspend or terminate the Agreement or any Purchase Order (or part thereof) or take other actions reasonably necessary to ensure full compliance with all laws including the Sanctions Laws without Licensor incurring any liability.
